# Messy
Sounds like message, but when a lot of people sends messages, it gets messy!

This is an open source chatting server solution. There are a lot of start ups or individuals who want to make great products. 
But they always hurdle into some things that they have to implement from ground up! I wanted to help these developers to make their apps as fast as they can and show their app to the world!
I also wanted to make this server handle a lot of requests at once! So all the people who use this will be able to scale with low computing cost.
